### Set Up

If you haven't already, please read _README.md_ then _GETTING_STARTED.md_ first, then come back here. 

In order to do all of things we need you to do, there are some configration/set up steps you'll need to follow:
(Please note, if you are a Windows user, we just ask that you ask us for help before completing any of these steps. Documentation for the process for you will be here soon, but until then, come say hello!)

1. Git! We use Github all the time, and we're gonna need you to download it. We will also generally talk about Git in the context of a command line, so you'll want to use the command line version (of course, you're welcome to use the graphical desktop version, but we can't guarantee support for it in what we do). If you don't already have a Github account, please go to https://github.com and make one. 

2. Get an editor! We don't care which one you use, and there are many great ones out there - Atom, Sublime, Emacs, Vim, Visual Studio Code, etc. - just pick one that you like and get familiar with it, you'll be using it a lot!

3. CS50.me - we use CS50's check50 to let you check your assignments and get feedback on them, so you'll need an account with CS50.me. Fortunately, you can simply sign in with your Github account and you'll be good to go! (This will not affect/conflict with your CS50 assignments. We will not be submitting through submit50, so don't worry about that.) You may need to authorize submit50 and check50 the first time you run our ```check``` command, but otherwise it will work very similarly to how it worked if you took CS50. 

4. Speaking of checking assignments - although there will be a process involving pull requests (don't worry, we explain later) and github for submission, checking is quite easy. We need you to run the install script in this directory (we encourage you to take a glance at the contents of the install file to see what's what). To do so, please run:
```bash
./install
```
That's it, seriously. If you get a permission error, then please run
```bash
chmod +x install
```
But otherwise, that should take you through a simple set up to get ```check``` working specifically for this comp. From then on, you'll check your assignments with ```check ###``` where "###" is the assignment number. 

5. You're done!

TLDR:
1. Download the Git commandline utility, and make an account on Github

2. Text editor/IDE

3. CS50.me

4. Run ```./install```

5. Go code!

Best,

Your Comp Directors
