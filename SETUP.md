### Set Up

If you haven't already, please read _README.md_ then _GETTING_STARTED.md_ first, then come back here. 

In order to do all of things we need you to do, there are some configration/set up steps you'll need to follow:
(Please note, if you are a Windows user, we just ask that you ask us for help before completing any of these steps. Documentation for the process for you will be here soon, but until then, come say hello!)

1. Git! We use Github all the time, and we're gonna need you to download it. We will also generally talk about Git in the context of a command line, so you'll want to use the command line version (of course, you're welcome to use the graphical desktop version, but we can't guarantee support for it in what we do). If you don't already have a Github account, please go to https://github.com and make one. 

2. https://tech.thecrimson.com or tech.thecrimson for short. We hand-built this website for you, and we ask that you create an account on the site. This is the site where all of your assignments will be officially distributed and submitted. Make sure to use a decent profile picture since these will get hung up in The Crimson.

3. On tech.thecrimson, go ahead and check out the first two resources under the "Resources" tab. One is a virtual machine management utility - VirtualBox, and the other is the virtual machine that we built for you. Download both!

4. Finally, please install VirtualBox, and we will walk you through the next parts in our first meeting/later assignments.

Best,

Your Comp Directors
