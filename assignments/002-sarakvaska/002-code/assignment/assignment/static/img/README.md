## Modularity

It's a good practice to keep all of your static assets neat and organized, which we've started for you. If you decide to keep a local image on here, then be sure to stick it in this folder, and reference it in your html with something like this:
```html
<img src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/margaret_hamilton1.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1600" alt="Code to the moon" width="500">
```
