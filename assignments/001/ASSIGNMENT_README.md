## Assignment 001 README Doc
-----

#### Setup:
-----

So this is the next assignment for the CrimTech Comp process, and it's all about Django. The first step will be Github-based (we promised to get you well-acquainted, didn't we?). With that in mind, then please go ahead and navigate [here.](https://github.com/harvard-crimson/crimtechcomp/tree/master/assignments/001/ "Assignment Page") That link is the Github page for our comp assignments, and it does in fact hold each of the assignments. 

Once you've navigated to our Github, take a few moments to see what's up and figure out some stuff about how to play around with getting around. 

From there, you'll want to click on the root of this directory structure, or "crimtechcomp", and then use the little button in the top right of the screen in order to get the link by which you'll copy the entire repository. Copy this link into your clipboard, and then on your virtual machine, go ahead and type ```git clone link_here``` into a terminal window of choice. 

That previous step will clone the entire repository, even though you only need the current assignment, but don't worry, we'll add assignments to it as we go, and you'll want to use that structure later. 

Once you have our code, you can follow the instructions in the 001-code/README.md (it looks prettier if you view it on Github) to complete the assignment.

#### Submission:
-----

Alright, so you've finished the assignment and now want to submit. We only ask that you submit 5 documents, in the following order (to tech.thecrimson):

1. assignment/settings.py
2. my_app/urls.py
3. my_app/models.py
4. my_app/views.py
5. templates/index.html

Thank you and good luck!
