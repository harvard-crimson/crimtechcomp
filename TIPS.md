## A List of Tips and Notes 

1. Always check capitalization, spelling, and punctuation (is this English class?)! It sounds silly, but they're responsible for so many hours of miserable debugging that it's a worthwhile habit to get into. We won't roll our eyes here, but we'll have a good laugh together about the silliness of the bug that caused you a half an hour (or more) of irritation. 

2. Python cares a lot about spaces ('\s') and tabs ('\t'), so be careful of which you're using (be consistent), and be ready to accidentally trigger code where you didn't intend by forgetting to indent. Can also be the cause of the dreaded "inconsistent use of tabs and spaces" error (fix by being consistent and patient).

3. Do not change our function/class/method definitions unless we explicitly say you can. This can mess with our tests and cause working code to fail. It's not fun. Bad time. 0/10. Don't do it (unless we say it's ok!)
